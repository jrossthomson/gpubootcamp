    "## Motivation for the Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Since hurricanes (or tropical cyclones) possess substantial threats and cause significant damage to lives and properties, studying the stages of a hurricane is essential to determine its impact. From a scientific perspective, determining an accurate TC intensity helps. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* More accurate historical records of TCs, mainly if a technique can be consistently applied to older satellite imagery (i.e., intensity reanalysis)  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Providing consistent intensity estimates as current intensity estimates are made via a subjective algorithm (Dvorak technique) that is applied inconsistently in different forecast areas. Initial errors are too high, especially for weak and storms that are transitioning in structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS) along with intensity categorization for tropical storm and tropical depression as tropical cyclone (TC) intensity categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since TC intensity is based on maximum wind speeds (MWS), estimating the TC intensity by just using image content is a challenging problem. Several techniques utilize satellite imagery for estimating tropical cyclone intensity using Dvorak and deviation-angle variance technique (DAVT) techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt_text](Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_Estimation/images/cat+dvat.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dvorak Technique : \n",
    "\n",
    "The Dvorak technique is a method using enhanced Infrared and/or visible satellite imagery to quantitatively estimate the intensity of a tropical system. Cloud patterns in satellite imagery normally show an indication of cyclogenesis before the storm reaches tropical storm intensity. Indications of continued development and/or weakening can also be found in the cloud features. Using these features, the pattern formed by the clouds of a tropical cyclone, expected systematic development, and a series of rules, an intensity analysis and forecast can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary assumption of the Dvorak method is that cyclones with similar intensity tend to have a similar pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This Figure shows some development patterns used by the Dvorak technique. Once a pattern is detected over 24 hours, the features such as length and banding from the storm are further analyzed to reach a particular\n",
    "T-number. This relates tropical cloud structures to storm intensity. Nevertheless, this technique is not perfect and still suffers from subjective biases. Due to the inherent limitations of the empirical method used, it cannot determine subtropical cyclone intensity. Today, with the successful application of the Dvorak technique for more than 30 years along with some modifications and improvements, it is used worldwide for TC intensity estimation. The Advanced Dvorak Technique provides a nearly instantaneous estimate of TC intensity objectively. It removes a large amount of the subjectivity inherent in the process and produces errors similar to a human in most cases. But despite these attempts the errors can be high during the initial phase for weak storms that are transitioning in structure. "

    "##### Multi-Class Cross-Entropy loss : \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we understand how the loss value is calculated, let us understand how the outputs are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train our model , we convert all the categories to a array of 1's and 0's. Let us assume we have a model to predict if a given image is a cat or a dog, we will then start labelling all the outputs in our dataset and assign `cat = [ 1 , 0 ]` and `dog = [ 0 , 1 ] ` and we will then train our model based on it, our model will then predict the probabilities of the output of what it thinks it to be, let's say we give it an image of a cat, we get the output to be `[ 0.87 , 0.13]` which implies that the model is 87% confident that it is a cat,but this is still not good enough we then calculate the error in this case with the following equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Loss = J(w) = - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\left[ y_n \\log{\\hat{y_n}} + (1 - y_n) \\log{(1-\\hat{y_n})}  \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So ,if we try calculating the loss in our case from the equation , we will try calculating loss value for different values \n",
    "\n",
    "$ Loss = - \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\log{0.87} + (1 - 0) \\log{(1 - 0.13)} \\right] = -1 * \\log{0.87} = 0.060 $\n",
    "\n",
    "If our model trained over time and if the output would be `[ 0.90 , 0.10 ]` , then let's calculate our loss again.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Loss = - \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\log{0.90} + (1 - 0) \\log{(1 - 0.10)} \\right] = -1 * \\log{0.90} = 0.045 $\n",

    "Starting at the top of the mountain, we take our first step downhill in the direction specified by the negative gradient. Next, we recalculate the negative gradient (passing in the coordinates of our new point) and take another step in the direction it specifies. We continue this process iteratively until we get to the bottom of our graph, or to a point where we can no longer move downhill–a local minimum.\n",

    "GD runs through all the samples in training set to do a single update for a parameter in a particular iteration. In SGD, on the other hand, you use only one or subset of training sample from your training set to do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration. \n",
